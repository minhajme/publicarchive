**Property listing crawler from Bikroy.com, grown from a personal need**
-
The project was conceived when I was looking for commercial space for rent but browsing Bikroy.com every now and then was quite strenuous. So I wrote some crawler scripts with Symfony domcrawler, running on top of a micro framework I written before.
Later I added login and userspace data seperation upon requests from colleagues.
