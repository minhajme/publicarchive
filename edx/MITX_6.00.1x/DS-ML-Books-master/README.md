# DS-ML-Books

This repository includes the books about data science, machine learning and statistical methods.

The books are:

------------------------------------------------------------
*The Elements of Statistical Learning (ESL)*

Authors: Trevor Hastie, Robert Tibshirani, and Jerome Friedman

This book descibes the important ideas in these areas in a common conceptual framework. While the approach is statistical, the emphasis is on concepts rather than mathematics. Many examples are given, with a liberal use of color graphics. It should be a valuable resource for statisticians and anyone interested in data mining in science or industry. The book's coverage is broad, from supervised learning (prediction) to unsupervised learning. The many topics include neural networks, support vector machines, classification trees and boosting--the first comprehensive treatment of this topic in any book.

*An Introduction to Statistical Learning with Applications in R*

Authors: Gareth James, Daniela Witten, Trevor Hastie, and Robert Tibshirani

This book provides an introduction to statistical learning methods. It is aimed for upper level undergraduate students, masters students and Ph.D. students in the non-mathematical sciences. The book also contains a number of R labs with detailed explanations on how to implement the various methods in real life settings, and should be a valuable resource for a practicing data scientist.

*Foundations of Data Science*

Authors: Avrim Blum, John Hopcroft, and Ravindran Kannan

While traditional areas of computer science remain highly important, increasingly researchers of the future will be involved with using computers to understand and extract usable information from massive data arising in applications, not just how to make computers useful on specific well-defined problems. With this in mind we have written this book to cover the theory likely to be useful in the next 40 years, just as an understanding of automata theory, algorithms, and related topics gave students an advantage in the last 40 years.

*Think Stats: Probability and Statistics for Programmers*

Author: Allen B. Downey

Think Stats is an introduction to Probability and Statistics for Python programmers.
Think Stats emphasizes simple techniques you can use to explore real data sets and answer interesting questions. The book presents a case study using data from the National Institutes of Health. Readers are encouraged to work on a project with real datasets.

*Introduction to Computation and Programming using Python*

Author: John Guttag

This book introduces students with little or no prior programming experience to the art of computational problem solving using Python and various Python libraries, including PyLab. It provides students with skills that will enable them to make productive use of computational techniques, including some of the tools and techniques of "data science" for using computation to model and interpret data. The book is based on an MIT course (which became the most popular course offered through MIT's OpenCourseWare) and was developed for use not only in a conventional classroom but in a massive open online course (or MOOC) offered by the pioneering MIT-Harvard collaboration edX.Students are introduced to Python and the basics of programming in the context of such computational concepts and techniques as exhaustive enumeration, bisection search, and efficient approximation algorithms. The book does not require knowledge of mathematics beyond high school algebra, but does assume that readers are comfortable with rigorous thinking and not intimidated by mathematical concepts. Although it covers such traditional topics as computational complexity and simple algorithms, the book focuses on a wide range of topics not found in most introductory texts, including information visualization, simulations to model randomness, computational techniques to understand data, and statistical techniques that inform (and misinform) as well as two related but relatively advanced topics: optimization problems and dynamic programming. Introduction to Computation and Programming Using Python can serve as a stepping-stone to more advanced computer science courses, or as a basic grounding in computational problem solving for students in other disciplines.

*Data Driven Science & Engineering: Machine Learning, Dynamical Systems, and Control*

Authors: Steven L. Brunton & J. Nathan Kutz

This book is about the growing intersection of data-driven methods, applied optimization, and the classical fields of engineering mathematics and mathematical physics.

*A Primer On Scientific Programming with Python* 

Author: Hans Petter Langtangen

The aim of this book is to teach computer programming using examples from mathematics and the natural sciences. We have chosen to use the Python programming language because it combines remarkable expressive power with very clean, simple, and compact syntax. Python is easy to learn and very well suited for an introduction to computer programming. Python is also quite similar to MATLAB and a good language for doing mathematical computing.The examples in this book integrate programming with applications to mathe- matics, physics, biology, and finance. The reader is expected to have knowledge of basic one-variable calculus as taught in mathematics-intensive programs in high schools. It is certainly an advantage to take a university calculus course in parallel, preferably containing both classical and numerical aspects of calculus. Although not strictly required, a background in high school physics makes many of the ex- amples more meaningful.

*Data Analysis Statistical and Computational Methods for Scientists and Engineers*

Author: Siegmund Brandt

The programs in this book are written in the modern programming language Java.The Java language offers a number of advantages over the older program- ming languages used in earlier editions. It is object-oriented and hence also more readable. It includes access to libraries of user-friendly auxiliary rou- tines, allowing for instance the easy creation of windows for input, output, or graphics. For most popular computers, Java is either preinstalled or can be downloaded from the Internet free of charge.Our Java programs for data analysis and for the production of graphics, including many example programs and solutions to programming problems, can be downloaded from the page extras.springer.com.

*Statistics And Analysis Of Scientific Data*

Author: Massimiliano Bonamente

Across all sciences, a quantitative analysis of data is necessary to assess the significance of experiments, observations, and calculations. This book was written over a period of 10 years, as the author developed an introductory graduate course on statistics and data analysis at the University of Alabama in Huntsville. The author's goal was to put together the material that a student needs for the analysis and statistical interpretation of data, including an extensive set of applications and problems that illustrate the practice of statistical data analysis.
